HermesCards
==========
**Cheating the Hermes system** <-- missing punctuation

## Information
### What this does.. <-- i do not like the way you wrote this
Generate barcodes from the top and bottom calling card numbers, and allows you to scan them off one by one, also listens for the beep of the barcode reader to change. <-- i would like an image example

## Usage <-- what if i do not know what this word means..
Run the JAR <-- how to you run a jam jar.. or EXE <-- i think you should specify that it is a file with the extension .exe, enter the top and bottom calling card barcode numbers (they are usually in packs of 100 so the top would be 5555101, and the bottom would be 5555001 <-- wow, informative stuff!), and scan away. <-- what does that mean?

## Compile
``mvn clean package`` it's as simple as that really.. <-- if its that simple how come it say "command mvn not found" ..... fat

## Why? <-- why what
Hermes is a god awful company, who treat the couriers like utter crap. <-- evidence before u slander maybe?? I don't work for them, however I know people who do. <-- prove it, i have a black uncle I've made this tool to assist in keeping pay reasonable (you don't get as much if you use the online interface), as well as make usage of the unbareable handsets they're provided, just slightly more easy.

Do not use this tool without consulting your boss first. <-- ERM THIS SOUNDS ILLEGAL!!!
